    Daniel Ma is a 2nd year student in the Civil Engineering program at UBC. His passion for all things aquatic life related led him to his interest in joining Green Joule. After his first year being part of the Growth subteam, he became the Co-Lead of Green Joule. He loves being a leader in team-oriented environments and is always ready and willing to support his members. He hopes that Green Joule will truly push the limits of biofuels and pave the way towards a future of sustainable energy use. In his spare time, Daniel is a musician - a pianist, singer, and beatboxer - who enjoys performing at events. He is also an avid nature aquarium hobbyist who loves creating underwater worlds inspired by nature using live aquatic plants, fish, rocks and driftwood, and other nature decor.
