## Thank You
We'd like to thank our sponsors for their kind support and various contributions, without which our student-led projects would not have been possible. As a sponsor, your contributions help fund student development and professional growth for undergraduate students.

Chem-E-Car would like to thank our exclusive Diamond sponsor, Daniel Family Foundation, and the UBC Student Competition Team Fund. Our progress as a design team would not be possible without your generous support.
